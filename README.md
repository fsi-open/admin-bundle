# FSi Admin Bundle

FSi Admin Bundle is complete solution that provides mechanisms to generate admin panel for any Symfony2 based application.

**Important** - admin bundle is not integrated with Symfony security component. By default route /admin is not protected
and you need to add security on your own.
