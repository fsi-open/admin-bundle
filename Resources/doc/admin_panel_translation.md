## Admin panel translation

Currently the bundle is available in two languages:
- english (en),
- polish (pl),

but you can easily add another language by creating a proper translation file.

To enable the language switcher in the main menu, you need to add following lines
to the ``config/config.yaml`` file:

```yaml
# config/config.yaml

fsi_admin:
    display_language_switch: true
```
